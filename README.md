Classification_Pandas.ipynb notebooks: Training of machine learning models.

Load_Picklefile.ipynb: Displays results and accuracy of each model against the overall dataset.

Top_Features_TFIDF.ipynb: Displays top TFIDF identifying features of differing political poles.

Top_Features_Frequency: Generates a Word Cloud regarding the frequency of key identifying features of differing political poles.

bag_of_features.xlsx: Top 40 TFIDF values of differing political poles trained on data where proper nouns were not considered as features for 18 models.  

top40_18models_frequency_final.xlsx: Frequency of key identifying features of differing political poles. Some features had ratios scaled down so as to not overshadow other features when generating the Word Cloud in Top_Features_Frequency. (Original frequencys: chop - 23:1, wuhan virus: 22.91:1, right wing: 74:1)
